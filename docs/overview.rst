The HAWC2Wrapper package provides a Python interface between the aeroservoelstic tools HAWCStab2 and HAWC2 and FUSED-Wind which is built using OpenMDAO as the underlying framework.

HAWCStab2 is an aeroservoelastic tool for three bladed horizontal axis wind turbines. It allows steady-states computations and stability analysis.
HAWC2 (Horizontal Axis Wind turbine simulation Code 2nd generation) is an aeroelastic code intended for calculating wind turbine response in time domain. 

HAWCStab2 and HAWC2 are licenced softwares. HAWCStab2 is available free of charge for academic use. For more information, see http://www.hawcstab2.vindenergi.dtu.dk and http://www.hawc2.dk.

This Python module facilitates using HAWCStab2 and HAWC2 for evaluating wind turbine aeroservoleastic responses. This tool can be used to perform wind turbine aeroservoleastic optimization.
